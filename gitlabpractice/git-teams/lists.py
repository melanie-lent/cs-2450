##Given 2 arrays of ints, a and b, return True if they have the same
##first element or they have the same last element. Both arrays will be
##length 1 or more.
def common_end(a, b):
    pass

##In this exercise, your function will receive 1 parameter,
##a list of strings.
##The function will return the last string from the list.
def laststring(strings):
    pass

##In this exercise, your function will receive 3 parameters,
##a list and two integers.  The function will return the
##slice of the list starting from the first index, and
##going to, but not including, the second index.
def middlelist(nums, a, b):
    pass

##Return the "centered" average of a list of integers,
##which we'll say is the mean average of the values, except
##ignoring the largest and smallest values in the list.
##If there are multiple copies of the smallest value,
##ignore just one copy, and likewise for the largest value.
##Use integer division to produce the final average.
##You may assume that the list is length 3 or more.
def centered_average(nums):
    pass

##Return the number of even integers in the given list.
##Note: the % "mod" operator computes the remainder,
##e.g. 5 % 2 is 1.
def count_evens(nums):
    pass
