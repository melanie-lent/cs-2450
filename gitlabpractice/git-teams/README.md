# Gitlab Collaboration Assignment

This repository holds various programming practice drills (taken from Code
Grinder). Follow the assignment instructions on Canvas to create, implement, and
merge issues to collaboratively complete the drills with your team.

Once you have correctly implemented a drill problem, ensuring that your solution
passes the relevant tests. You should commit your changes in `git` then submit a
merge request on GitLab (https://gitlab2450.cs.dixie.edu). Someone in your group
should review your changes and merge your request if the relevant tests pass.
