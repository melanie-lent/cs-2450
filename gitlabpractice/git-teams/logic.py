##The squirrels in Palo Alto spend most of the day playing.
##In particular, they play if the temperature is between
##60 and 90 (inclusive). Unless it is summer, then the
##upper limit is 100 instead of 90. Given an integer
##temperature and a boolean `is_summer`, return `True`
##if the squirrels play and `False` otherwise.

#You and your date are trying to get a table at a restaurant. The
#parameter "you" is the stylishness of your clothes, in the range 0..10,
#and "date" is the stylishness of your date's clothes. The result
#getting the table is encoded as an int value with 0=no, 1=maybe, 2=yes.
#If either of you is very stylish, 8 or more, then the result is 2
#(yes). With the exception that if either of you has style of 2 or less,
