# The IDE I chose is:
Visual Studio Code.

# Who made it?
It was made by Microsoft.

# When was it first made?
It was first released in 2015.

# Is it open source?
Sort of. The version you can download from the official website is not open source, but the code you can download from the official repo is.

#Why did I choose this?
1. Installing add-ons is quick and easy.
2. There's a lot of good documentation for it. (I'm also learning C# right now.)
3. I find the interface well-designed and easy to work with.
